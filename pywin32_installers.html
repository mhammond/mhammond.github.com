<h1>pywin32 .exe installers are deprecated</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/">pywin32</a> project has
    traditionally offered .exe files for installation, but this is going to
    stop soon.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/pypa/distutils/pull/170">Support for building these
    installers has been removed from setuptools</a>; you can't make them with
    recent versions. So at some point in the future they can't be provided.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/">You should move to installation via <code>pip</code></a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To install via <code>pip</code>, execute
        <pre>python -m pip install pywin32</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        To upgrade, execute
        <pre>python -m pip install pywin32 --upgrade</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
